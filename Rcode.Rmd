## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = read.csv('data/TC.csv')
X = read.csv('data/X.csv')
D = data.matrix(df)
norm(D%*%t(D), type="O")

test = matrix(c(1,2,62.5,3,2,3,3,2,8), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
norm(test)

matrix( 0 ,6, 1 )

A = matrix(0, 6, 1)
A[4,1] = -25
2.5*sign(A)*pmax(replicate(6, 0), abs(A)-0.3)
sign(A)
pmax(replicate(6, 0), abs(A)-0.3)
Alr <- matrix ( 0 ,6 , 441 )

Ao <- matrix ( 0 , 6, 1 )

A <- Ao+2.5 *(t(D)%*%(X[,k]-(D%*%Ao ) ) )
A =  (1/(1+ 2.5 ) ) * (sign(A)*pmax (replicate(6, 0 ), abs(A)-2.5 ) )
pmax (replicate(6, 0 ), abs(A)-2.5 )
b = X[,k]
a = X[,k]-(D%*%Ao )

?svd
test = svd(D)
test

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
